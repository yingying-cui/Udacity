# Project Motivation
In ancient Rome, transporting goods like olive oil across the vast empire relied on ceramic vessels called amphorae.
One of the most common types — Dressel 20 amphorae — was used to ship olive oil from Hispania (modern-day Spain) to distant Roman provinces.
I used Dressel 20 data to explore the following questions:
* Were these amphorae consistently produced?
* Did different workshops influence each other, or were they working in isolation?
* When information like production dates is missing — can modern data science help us fill in the gaps?
# File Description
* `dressel20.ipynb`: Code that helps to analyze the above questions.
* `dataDressel`: Original data, the source is from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2018.06.002).
* `README.md`: A quick summary of the project.
